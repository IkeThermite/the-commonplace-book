# John Danaher - Go Further Faster Volume 6 - Passing the Guard
Fundamental Guard Passes:
 - Double Under Pass
 - Over Under Pass
 - Knee Cut Pass
 - Toreando Pass
 - Leg Drag
 - Long Step Pass
 - Smash Pass

## Nomenclature
- Centerline: The line that bisects my opponent's left and right side.
- Left Diagonal: The line that runs from my opponent's right shoulder to his left hip.
- Right Diagonal: The line that runs from my opponent's left shoulder to his right hip.
- Kneeline: The line that connects my opponent's left and right knee.
- Toeline: The line that connects the toes of my opponent's left and right foot.
- Hipline: The line that connects my opponent's left and right hip bone.

Grips are described as follows:
``(Left | Right) (Straight | Cross) [High | Mid | Low] (Location)``
- ``(Left | Right)`` refers to which hand I am gripping with.
- ``(Straight | Cross | Center)`` refers to whether or not the grip crosses my opponent's centerline. A straight grip is a "near side" grip, not crossing the centerline. A center grip is on the centerline. A cross grip is a "far side" grip, which crosses the centerline.
- ``[High | Mid | Low]`` optionally refers to where the grip is placed on the ``(Location)``.
- ``(Location)`` refers to which part of my opponent's body or gi I am gripping.

 ## The Double Under Pass
 - Challenge is always to pass someone's guard while they are attacking you.
 - Double Under position negates most attacks and most major forms of open guard (tremendous shutdown effect).

Trigger:
- Exposed hamstrings. If I can see my partner's hamstrings, I can drop to the Double Under position. If I cannot expose his hamstrings (get his feet higher than his knees), I have to change passes.

**Technique:**  
*Training partner is on his back, knees tucked to his chest, heels pulled to his buttocks. I'm standing, approaching the guard.*

1. Step forward, but stay outside opponent's Toe Line.
2. Grip the soles of his feet (thumb in soles grip) and run his feet over his head, pointing them at the ceiling. Do NOT expose sleeve cuffs to opponent! Alternative: Grip underneath his Achilles tendons. 
3. Pinch with my knees and drop down to Double Under grips, but form a slight angle to his body (shift to my right). Back of his left knee must be on my shoulder.
4. First concern is alignment with his Left Diagonal. To anchor to this line, I grab his far lapel with my right hand, just below the line of his pectorals (Right Cross Mid Lapel Grip).
5. Tuck my elbow tightly into his body, difficult for him to expose it and start his guard retention. *Note that this is a tradeoff between elbow exposure and head control.*
6. My right knee stays on the mat as I drive off my left foot (raising my left knee).
7. Take Left Center Drawstring grip.
8. Bring left knee as a wedge behind partner's lower back. My head is directly over his head; this negates his Shoulder Walk counter.
    - **CHECKPOINT:** Plough Position.
9. Move right hand to Right Cross High Lapel Grip to gain head control.
10. Start driving hips forward by taking my right knee off the floor and arch my body.
11. Bring right elbow over his head and settle down into a side pin.

**Alternative - Advanced Variation:**  
*I have Double Under grips, but can't raise his right leg to my shoulder. Or I can raise his leg, but he is very good at Shoulder Walking backwards.*
1. Bring his left knee to his Centerline and push the opposite knee to the mat. *Note: This position is exactly our Stack passing entry series.*
2. Duck down (level change) to get it onto my shoulder. 
2. Then raise his hips up just enough that I can bring my left hand to Center Drawstring Grip.
2. Now lift and bring opponent's toes to the mat.
    - **CHECKPOINT:** Plough Position.
3. My opponent can post his left hand on my hip and make it very difficult to drive into him. So instead, I use my head to clear his legs.
4. Bring my head down to his thigh and drive it across the Hipline to his far hip. Head is a battering ram that turns the corner.

**The Centerline**  
When I am centered with my opponent, he can easily makes his legs very heavy. I want to be aligned with his Left Diagonal.

**Getting Underneath His Legs**  
Don't try to swim or pummel underneath his legs with your arms! This will expose you to various types of open guard, i.e., Lasso and Spider variations.
