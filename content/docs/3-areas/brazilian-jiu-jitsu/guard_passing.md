# Passing the Guard

## Guard Passing Positions
These positions form the central nodes in my system of guard passing.

**Full Staple:**
 - Left knee through, pointing in towards his hip. Toes hooked pointing out.
 - His leg on my right shoulder, right hand Mid Straight Lapel Grip, right elbow tight.
 - Head low, looking across far shoulder. Whole body oriented *into* him.
 - Palm facing on left pants grip to defend against Ude Katame and Sankaku Jime.

## Guard Passing Techniques

### Over Under Pass

#### Guard Retention

Guard Retention Phases:
    
1.  Opponent is kneeling, trapping one of my legs between his with a low grip on my gi pants. He has his other arm underneath my far leg, gripping my belt.
2.  Opponent has tripoded up, connected his shoulder to my centerline and placed his head in position. He is attempting to cover my knee.
3.  Opponent has covered my knee and is attempting to reverse / square up, pointing my hips away from him.
4.  Alternative: Opponent is just about to cover my knee, but I have deep / good inside leg position.

{{< expand "Phase 1: [Opponent has grips] $\rightarrow$ Frame and Hip Escape" "+" >}}
   
*Opp. is sitting on top of one foot, low grip on gi pants, far arm under far leg. Everything begins with the lead shoulder. What keeps his shoulder in place is his head position.*
1.  Post heel of near hand against opponent's shoulder.
2.  Insert Cross Collar grip with far hand to block lead shoulder (hasn't solved far shoulder problem, opp. can shake his head left and right).
3.  Hip out to the far side and bring knee as a wedge to his far shoulder. My knee and elbow connect.
4.  As soon as I can, shift a little more out and bring my foot to his shoulder.
5.  Pummel foot through, make space and free trapped leg.
6.  Immediately go to Closed Guard.

{{< expand "Phase 2: [Opponent in Tripod] $\rightarrow$ Move Head" "+" >}}
    
*Too late to prevent lead shoulder position, he has connected his shoulder to my centerline and placed his head in position. I must try to prevent him from covering my knee. Before he covers my knee, I can attempt to move his head to the other side.*
1.  Take my forearm and hold his head.
2.  Push off my knee and straighten my body out. Moving my body around his head.
3.  Take opposite elbow over his head and start to come up (using my leg like a pendulum), reaching to grab his belt and covering his head.
4.  Grab his gi pants and bump him down to his shoulder.
    1.  If he brings his head back to the center, go to Triangle Lock / Closed Guard instead.
5.  Place hand on the floor and come up.

## Guard Passing Sequences

### Stack and Staple Sequences
{{< expand "Closed Guard $\rightarrow$ Full Staple" "+" >}}

*Original sequence is from Fabio Gurgel. 
I have replaced his Guard Break with the traditional Standing Guard Break.*
1. I finish the traditional Standing Guard Break. I have a staggered stance (left foot back).
2.  By pinching my lead (right) knee in, I can make it difficult for him to pull guard. I pull my right elbow back tight onto my knee.
8.  Now I step my left leg forward (square), take a straight lapel grip and connect my left knee to my elbow. For my opponent to build a guard, he now has to hip escape to one side.
9.  To force him to one side I can drive my left elbow down and my left knee to the mat over his thigh (Staple) and take my Scoop Grip with my right hand and grab Straight Lapel Grip $\rightarrow$ Full Staple.
    * If he hip escapes, I immediately Staple his bottom leg and Scoop his top leg.

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Stack Pass" "+" >}}
  
1.  Left hand feeds High Cross Lapel grip to right hand. Take Thumb Down grip.
2.  Move left hand back to his leg, elbow tight, safe peosition.
3.  Drive forward off the toes, changing direction from top near shoulder to far shoulder.
4.  Take left hand all the way to the back of his pants.
5.  Bring his hip high and place my left knee underneath it to take his weight.\\
6.  Press belly forward to complete the pass (into the side of his hip) to complete the pass. DON'T walk around!

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames] $\rightarrow$ Full Staple" "+" >}}

*My opponent frames too well (my hips and head) for me to complete the Stack.*
1.  As above, I initiate the Stack to my right side and take my lapel grip.
2.  Opponent frames my hip well, and he frames my face. I can't penetrate over the bicep over or around the bicep with my knee.
3.  Now I switch sides, going to Full Staple position with my left knee through.

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Long Step" "+" >}}
    
*The gripping here is different to the Back Step, where I would keep my right hand cupping the leg.*
1.  Make sure I am looking to the other side now, both knees pointing in a new direction.
2.  I am keeping my lapel grip with my right hand, I release my left hand grip and reach deep over his near shoulder (Cross Face), for his far armpit. I must hug the head for a Long Step pass.
3.  Now release the lapel grip and Long Step. Move the right hand to the bottom knee.
4.  As I step, try to get my hips in line with his head.

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Long Step $\rightarrow$ [Bicep Frame] $\rightarrow$  Knee Slide" "+" >}}
    
*My opponent prevents the control of the head necessary for the Long Step.*
1.  After I have switched to the Full Staple as above, my opponent blocks my bicep preventing the Cross Face.
2.  When he cups my bicep, my left hand immediately cups his tricep. Grap and pull in.
3.  Keep lapel grip and keep looking over his far shoulder. Open my left knee for some space.
4.  Raise my hips and cut my right knee through. As soon as it lands, post my left leg out.
5.  Apply pressure to stretch him out. If can pummel my left arm through, the Overhook is better than the tricep grip.
6.  I cut my right knee through, then reverse, walking my knees underneath him.
7.  I can let the collar grip go when I have set Cross Face.

{{< expand "Bull Fight $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames] $\rightarrow$ Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ [Heavy Leg] $\rightarrow$ Over Under" "+" >}}
    
*NOTE: Bull Fight $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames / High Step] $\rightarrow$ Stack vs Bull Fight $\rightarrow$ [Up on Elbow] $\rightarrow$ Switch Sides*
1.  Bull Fight Position: Opponent is on his back, my right hand at his left hip, my left hand gripping his knee.
2.  Use my outside (right) elbow to control his far leg. As he frames powerfully, I knock my right elbow underneath his knee and pummel for the Stack (lapel grip).
3.  Throughout, I am keeping his left knee pinned to the mat. When I take a Scoop grip, my grip must be *behind* his leg (to make the Triangle hard).
4.  If he becomes heavy on that leg to prevent me reaching his lapel, I can grab his belt instead.
5.  Drop my shoulder in to the Over Under position. (Always walk back to the center to flatten.)

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames] $\rightarrow$ Over Under" "+" >}}
    
1.  As above, I initiate the Stack to my right side, and take my lapel grip (close my elbow!).
2.  Opponent frames my hip well, and he frames my face. I can't penetrate over the bicep.
3.  Using my left hand, push his knee all the way *down*, until his leg is almost straight.
4.  Jump over my own left arm. As my left knee connects outside his leg, let the grip go and grab over his leg.
5.  Completely change angle to the other side. Move right hand to the near lapel.
6.  Pinch my knees, keeping my opponent's feet off the mat.
7.  My opponent will hook with his right leg.
8.  I walk back towards his hips, until his hips are *flat*. Then I can Windshield Wiper my leg out.
9.  Ideally, reach under this arm to grip behind his collar with my left hand.
10. Lapel grip is the last grip to give up.

{{< expand "Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ Double Under" "+" >}}
    
1.  As above, I initiate the Stack to my right side, and take my lapel grip (close the elbow!).
2.  Pinch my left knee down onto his leg for control.
3.  Release my left knee grip and take a hip grip under his thigh.
4.  Square up and start to Double Under Stack.

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Long Step $\rightarrow$ [High Step] $\rightarrow$ Duck Under" "+" >}}
    
*After the "completion" of the Long Step, my opponent steps his far leg over my head.*
1.  After the completion of the Long Step, my opponent frames me away.
2.  He starts to hip escape and weave his far leg over (I control his bottom leg).
3.  Underhook (Duck Under) his weaving leg with my left arm and close my left elbow.
4.  Drive to my left (over his head), *not* across.
5.  Slide my right knee through (staple), then release my right hand and reach for his hips (belt behind his back).
6.  As I Windshield Wipe my left leg, I start to stack immediately, keeping my grip on his hips.
7.  Drag his leg tight with my left hand, then pummel it over and grip his collar.
