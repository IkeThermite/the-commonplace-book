2.  Seated Guard $\rightarrow$ Collar Sleeve

    *The game is about getting a single Straight Sleeve Grip. Everything comes from there.*
    
    1.  Establish Collar and Sleeve grips. (I can set this up with just the sleeve, by being aggressive with the Half Lasso.)
    2.  Fall back immediately. Right foot to bicep, left foot takes Half Lasso (in front of neck).
    3.  Goal is to get his gripped hand above my hips.
    4.  Now the left foot can safely unwind and go to the hip.
    5.  Left foot is responsible for the posture control.

3.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Triangle

    1.  First ensure his posture is properly broken.
    2.  Turn to my left hip (move my hips out a bit to my right), so that my left knee is inside his knee.
        -   This ensures that if he squats back, it doesn't save him from the Triangle.
    3.  Stomp down with both feet, pull him forward, and raise my hips into his armpit.
    4.  Right foot moves first, then left.

4.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep

    1.  Move foot from bicep to hip.
    2.  Push away with both feet while pulling my hips off the mat and underneath my opponent.
    3.  Pull my partner forward with my grips and tuck my knees to my chest.
    4.  Extend my legs and pull the collar over my head.
    5.  At the last moment, push the collar down towards my hips to flip my opponent overhead.
    6.  Back roll to mount.

5.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Grip Break] $\rightarrow$ Tripod Sweep

6.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Combat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep

    *Note that Combat Base requires that he has his knee inside my knee. If he doesn't $\rightarrow$ Triangle.*

7.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Clears the Foot] $\rightarrow$ Collar Sleeve De La Riva $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep

8.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Squat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep

    1.  Set up for Overhead Sweep as above, but partner bases back when I try to pull him forward (Step 3).
    2.  I use a pendulum motion to take the near side foot to Deep DLR Hook and I tuck his sleeve behind my calf. (I want my hips out to the side)
    3.  Push with my right foot and invert to left shoulder to finish (DLR Dump Sweep Position).
    4.  As he starts to fall, release the Sleeve Grip.

9.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Squat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Back Step Base] $\rightarrow$ Cross Sleeve DLR $\rightarrow$ Back Take

    *NOTE: This is experimental.*
    
    1.  I am attempting the Dump Sweep, but my opponent's base is too good OR he back steps his far leg.
    2.  Make sure my hips are out to the side (on top of his foot) and my hook is deep.
    3.  Release the Collar Grip and pass his sleeve from my left hand to my right hand.
    4.  Plant my right foot on the mat and try to kick him back with my Deep DLR hook.
    5.  Also use that base to hip escape towards his far leg so that I can grip his leg with my left hand.
    6.  Pummel my right foot inside and use it to square myself behind him. The pants and sleeve grip prevent motion to either side.
    7.  Once I'm square, reach my right hand up to his belt or pants.

10. DLR Dump Sweep $\rightarrow$ Basic Berimbolo

    1.  From DLR Dump Sweep: Left leg is Deep DLR Hook, right leg on top, right hand Armpit Collar Grip.
    2.  Use the Collar Grip and pull myself in to head butt my opponent's hip. As I raise my elbow, I invert, ducking my head under my arm $\rightarrow$ Berimbolo Position.
    3.  Hook both feet on the far side of my opponent (active toes / back heeling).
    4.  Reach my left hand for his far hip and grab the pants.
    5.  Roll over my right shoulder and kick my feet hard to the mat.
    6.  Pull right hand out and reach for the back of the collar.
    7.  Pull myself up until my head is above his head and then insert second hook (left leg). Push off the mat with my feet to help the climb.
