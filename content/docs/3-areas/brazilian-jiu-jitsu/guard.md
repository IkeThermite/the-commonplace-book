# Playing Guard

## No Gi Seated Guard
**Standing vs Seated Guard Options:**
1. Inside Position: Straight Hamstring (Headquarters) or Cross Hamstring (Cross Knee).
2. Around the Guard (Double Outside Position): Toreando / X Pass.
3. Over or Under the Guard: Rolling Kimura / Rolling Guillotine. Push back to Double Ankle or Double Under Grips.

<!-- **Seated Guard vs Standing Options:**
1. Double Inside Position: Shin to Shin vs Staggered Opponent. Idiot Sweep vs Square Opponent.
2. Inside Position: Sit Up Guard vs Upright Opponent. Reverse De La Riva vs Driving Opponent. -->

**Some Seated Guard Principles:**
- Don't want to be on my back. So sit curled up, shoulders in front of the line of my hips.
- Don't want to allow access to my feet. So keep them tight against my body and keep my hands ready to defend them.
- Head up, shoulders shrugged, but don't allow my opponent's head to come lower than mine.
- Post, scoot back and reset if he starts to win the grip fighting.

### Techniques
**Building Guard Against Over or Under Attempts**
{{< expand "[Leg Grab] $\rightarrow$ Arm Drag $\rightarrow$ Shin to Shin / Sit Up Guard" "+" >}}
- If my opponent reaches for my legs I can Arm Drag. 
- The Arm Drag feeds into the Single Leg or Shin to Shin, but NOT the Back Take. Against a standing opponent the Back Take leads to Three Quarter Mount.

{{< expand "[Shoulder Push] $\rightarrow$ Single Leg X" "+" >}}
1. As my opponent comes in to push against my left shoulder, I "Eat The Sandwhich". Take a 2-on-1 grip in the wrist of his reaching hand and pull it over and across.
2. As I fall back my right foot goes to the hip. This allows me to catch the left Sticky Hook.
3. Now I can collapse in with both knees. I load my opponent up and elevate. 
4. Left hand pulls the leg through and I enter Single Leg X.

**Building Guard Against Inside Position**
{{< expand "[Steps to Inside] $\rightarrow$ Shin to Shin / Sit Up Guard" "+" >}}
1. First contact: Grab the knee, without extending the elbow away from the body. Lean in, bring the shoulder forward.
    - If opponent is upright, circle hard to Sit Up Guard and start the Single Leg series.
    - If opponent is driving his knee forward, scoot hips back and pummel for Shin to Shin. (His bended knee gives access to his shin.)

{{< expand "[Steps to Inside, Pushes Back, Strong Cross Knee] $\rightarrow$ Reverse de la Riva $\rightarrow$ Shin to Shin / Sit Up Guard" "+" >}}

1. Opponent pushes me back hard and starts the Knee Cut.
2. Pull Reverse de la Riva and grip the back of both of his elbows.
3. Push him away hard and grip the back of his knee.
4. Use the grip to pull myself up to Shin to Shin Guard (or Sit Up Guard).

## Cross Collar Sleeve Guard
### Overview

**Three Keys to Dominant Position:**
 1. Keep opponent's head below his hips.
 2. Keep his lead elbow inside my hips.
 3. Keep his outside elbow out and away from his body.

**Some Principles:**
- Collar grip must be above his shoulder. Constantly work it up until it's behind his neck.
- Sticky foot on the bicep.
- Four points of connection make it easy to rotate with your opponent.
- Constantly bring my opponent's hands down to the mat by kicking his far leg away and pulling his collar down.
- If I lose the bicep connection, I must immediately kick his knee out and bring his hands down to the mat.
- Opponent dropping to two knees must be submission suicide for him.



### Techniques
{{< expand "Seated Guard $\rightarrow$ Cross Collar Sleeve Guard" "+" >}}
*Primary entry. Relies on the ability to establish Cross Collar Grip.*

1. Opponent has left foot forward. My right knee will be up, left leg folded, left hand posted behind me.
    - This mirroring is so that my Cross Collar grip can be used to square up my opponent. I want to pull his far leg forward.
2. I come forward, reaching my right hand for the Cross Collar grip. This may require a feint.
3. As soon as the grip is established, I fall backward, pulling my opponent square. I take Double Inside Position with my feet (Sticky Hooks).
    - Cross Collar Grip and Sticky Hooks mitigate most immediate passes.
4. From here, take Cuff Grip with left hand, take left foot to hip and right foot to bicep $\rightarrow$ Cross Collar Sleeve Guard.

{{< expand "Seated Guard $\rightarrow$ Half Lasso $\rightarrow$ Cross Collar Sleeve Guard" "+" >}}
*Secondary entry, when opponent denies Cross Collar Grip. Work from Cuff Grip instead. Cuff Grip with Half Lasso always provides collar access.*

1. Standard Seated Guard position, but opponent is hiding Cross Collar Grip. 
2. Take Cuff Grip with left hand and fall back doing two things at once:
    1. Pull his gripped hand above my hips.
    2. Bring left foot in front of his gripped right arm, toes by his shoulder $\rightarrow$ Half Lasso.
3. Take Cross Collar Grip with right hand and place right foot on far bicep.
4. Now the left foot can safely unwind from Half Lasso $\rightarrow$ Cross Collar Sleeve Guard.
    - Note: Hip foot and Cross Collar Grip are responsible for the posture control.

3.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Triangle

    1.  First ensure his posture is properly broken.
    2.  Turn to my left hip (move my hips out a bit to my right), so that my left knee is inside his knee.
        -   This ensures that if he squats back, it doesn't save him from the Triangle.
    3.  Stomp down with both feet, pull him forward, and raise my hips into his armpit.
    4.  Right foot moves first, then left.

4.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep

    1.  Move foot from bicep to hip.
    2.  Push away with both feet while pulling my hips off the mat and underneath my opponent.
    3.  Pull my partner forward with my grips and tuck my knees to my chest.
    4.  Extend my legs and pull the collar over my head.
    5.  At the last moment, push the collar down towards my hips to flip my opponent overhead.
    6.  Back roll to mount.

5.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Grip Break] $\rightarrow$ Tripod Sweep

6.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Combat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep

    *Note that Combat Base requires that he has his knee inside my knee. If he doesn't $\rightarrow$ Triangle.*

7.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Clears the Foot] $\rightarrow$ Collar Sleeve De La Riva $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep

8.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Squat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep

    1.  Set up for Overhead Sweep as above, but partner bases back when I try to pull him forward (Step 3).
    2.  I use a pendulum motion to take the near side foot to Deep DLR Hook and I tuck his sleeve behind my calf. (I want my hips out to the side)
    3.  Push with my right foot and invert to left shoulder to finish (DLR Dump Sweep Position).
    4.  As he starts to fall, release the Sleeve Grip.

9.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Squat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Back Step Base] $\rightarrow$ Cross Sleeve DLR $\rightarrow$ Back Take

    *NOTE: This is experimental.*
    
    1.  I am attempting the Dump Sweep, but my opponent's base is too good OR he back steps his far leg.
    2.  Make sure my hips are out to the side (on top of his foot) and my hook is deep.
    3.  Release the Collar Grip and pass his sleeve from my left hand to my right hand.
    4.  Plant my right foot on the mat and try to kick him back with my Deep DLR hook.
    5.  Also use that base to hip escape towards his far leg so that I can grip his leg with my left hand.
    6.  Pummel my right foot inside and use it to square myself behind him. The pants and sleeve grip prevent motion to either side.
    7.  Once I'm square, reach my right hand up to his belt or pants.

10. DLR Dump Sweep $\rightarrow$ Basic Berimbolo

    1.  From DLR Dump Sweep: Left leg is Deep DLR Hook, right leg on top, right hand Armpit Collar Grip.
    2.  Use the Collar Grip and pull myself in to head butt my opponent's hip. As I raise my elbow, I invert, ducking my head under my arm $\rightarrow$ Berimbolo Position.
    3.  Hook both feet on the far side of my opponent (active toes / back heeling).
    4.  Reach my left hand for his far hip and grab the pants.
    5.  Roll over my right shoulder and kick my feet hard to the mat.
    6.  Pull right hand out and reach for the back of the collar.
    7.  Pull myself up until my head is above his head and then insert second hook (left leg). Push off the mat with my feet to help the climb.
