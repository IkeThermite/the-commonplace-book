## Guard Passing Positions
These positions form the central nodes in my system of guard passing.

**Full Staple:**
 - Left knee through, pointing in towards his hip. Toes hooked pointing out.
 - His leg on my right shoulder, right hand Mid Straight Lapel Grip, right elbow tight.
 - Head low, looking across far shoulder. Whole body oriented *into* him.
 - Palm facing on left pants grip to defend against Ude Katame and Sankaku Jime.

{{< expand "Closed Guard $\rightarrow$ Full Staple" "+" >}}

*Original sequence is from Fabio Gurgel. 
I have replaced his Guard Break with the traditional Standing Guard Break.*
1. I finish the traditional Standing Guard Break. I have a staggered stance (left foot back).
2.  By pinching my lead (right) knee in, I can make it difficult for him to pull guard. I pull my right elbow back tight onto my knee.
8.  Now I step my left leg forward (square), take a straight lapel grip and connect my left knee to my elbow. For my opponent to build a guard, he now has to hip escape to one side.
9.  To force him to one side I can drive my left elbow down and my left knee to the mat over his thigh (Staple) and take my Scoop Grip with my right hand and grab Straight Lapel Grip $\rightarrow$ Full Staple.
    * If he hip escapes, I immediately Staple his bottom leg and Scoop his top leg.

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Stack Pass" "+" >}}
  
1.  Left hand feeds High Cross Lapel grip to right hand. Take Thumb Down grip.
2.  Move left hand back to his leg, elbow tight, safe peosition.
3.  Drive forward off the toes, changing direction from top near shoulder to far shoulder.
4.  Take left hand all the way to the back of his pants.
5.  Bring his hip high and place my left knee underneath it to take his weight.\\
6.  Press belly forward to complete the pass (into the side of his hip) to complete the pass. DON'T walk around!

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames] $\rightarrow$ Full Staple" "+" >}}

*My opponent frames too well (my hips and head) for me to complete the Stack.*
1.  As above, I initiate the Stack to my right side and take my lapel grip.
2.  Opponent frames my hip well, and he frames my face. I can't penetrate over the bicep over or around the bicep with my knee.
3.  Now I switch sides, going to Full Staple position with my left knee through.

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Long Step" "+" >}}
    
*The gripping here is different to the Back Step, where I would keep my right hand cupping the leg.*
1.  Make sure I am looking to the other side now, both knees pointing in a new direction.
2.  I am keeping my lapel grip with my right hand, I release my left hand grip and reach deep over his near shoulder (Cross Face), for his far armpit. I must hug the head for a Long Step pass.
3.  Now release the lapel grip and Long Step. Move the right hand to the bottom knee.
4.  As I step, try to get my hips in line with his head.

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Long Step $\rightarrow$ [Bicep Frame] $\rightarrow$  Knee Slide" "+" >}}
    
*My opponent prevents the control of the head necessary for the Long Step.*
1.  After I have switched to the Full Staple as above, my opponent blocks my bicep preventing the Cross Face.
2.  When he cups my bicep, my left hand immediately cups his tricep. Grap and pull in.
3.  Keep lapel grip and keep looking over his far shoulder. Open my left knee for some space.
4.  Raise my hips and cut my right knee through. As soon as it lands, post my left leg out.
5.  Apply pressure to stretch him out. If can pummel my left arm through, the Overhook is better than the tricep grip.
6.  I cut my right knee through, then reverse, walking my knees underneath him.
7.  I can let the collar grip go when I have set Cross Face.

{{< expand "Bull Fight $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames] $\rightarrow$ Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ [Heavy Leg] $\rightarrow$ Over Under" "+" >}}
    
*NOTE: Bull Fight $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames / High Step] $\rightarrow$ Stack vs Bull Fight $\rightarrow$ [Up on Elbow] $\rightarrow$ Switch Sides*
1.  Bull Fight Position: Opponent is on his back, my right hand at his left hip, my left hand gripping his knee.
2.  Use my outside (right) elbow to control his far leg. As he frames powerfully, I knock my right elbow underneath his knee and pummel for the Stack (lapel grip).
3.  Throughout, I am keeping his left knee pinned to the mat. When I take a Scoop grip, my grip must be *behind* his leg (to make the Triangle hard).
4.  If he becomes heavy on that leg to prevent me reaching his lapel, I can grab his belt instead.
5.  Drop my shoulder in to the Over Under position. (Always walk back to the center to flatten.)

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ [Strong Frames] $\rightarrow$ Over Under" "+" >}}
    
1.  As above, I initiate the Stack to my right side, and take my lapel grip (close my elbow!).
2.  Opponent frames my hip well, and he frames my face. I can't penetrate over the bicep.
3.  Using my left hand, push his knee all the way *down*, until his leg is almost straight.
4.  Jump over my own left arm. As my left knee connects outside his leg, let the grip go and grab over his leg.
5.  Completely change angle to the other side. Move right hand to the near lapel.
6.  Pinch my knees, keeping my opponent's feet off the mat.
7.  My opponent will hook with his right leg.
8.  I walk back towards his hips, until his hips are *flat*. Then I can Windshield Wiper my leg out.
9.  Ideally, reach under this arm to grip behind his collar with my left hand.
10. Lapel grip is the last grip to give up.

{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Stack Pass $\rightarrow$ Double Under" "+" >}}
    
1.  As above, I initiate the Stack to my right side, and take my lapel grip (close the elbow!).
2.  Pinch my left knee down onto his leg for control.
3.  Release my left knee grip and take a hip grip under his thigh.
4.  Square up and start to Double Under Stack.

{{< /expand >}}


{{< expand "Full Staple $\rightarrow$ Long Step $\rightarrow$ [High Step] $\rightarrow$ Duck Under" "+" >}}
    
*After the "completion" of the Long Step, my opponent steps his far leg over my head.*
1.  After the completion of the Long Step, my opponent frames me away.
2.  He starts to hip escape and weave his far leg over (I control his bottom leg).
3.  Underhook (Duck Under) his weaving leg with my left arm and close my left elbow.
4.  Drive to my left (over his head), *not* across.
5.  Slide my right knee through (staple), then release my right hand and reach for his hips (belt behind his back).
6.  As I Windshield Wipe my left leg, I start to stack immediately, keeping my grip on his hips.
7.  Drag his leg tight with my left hand, then pummel it over and grip his collar.

### Over Under Pass

1.  Guard Retention

    1.  Guard Retention Phases:
    
        1.  Opponent is kneeling, trapping one of my legs between his with a low grip on my gi pants. He has his other arm underneath my far leg, gripping my belt.
        2.  Opponent has tripoded up, connected his shoulder to my centerline and placed his head in position. He is attempting to cover my knee.
        3.  Opponent has covered my knee and is attempting to reverse / square up, pointing my hips away from him.
        4.  Alternative: Opponent is just about to cover my knee, but I have deep / good inside leg position.
    
    2.  Phase 1: [Opponent has grips] $\rightarrow$ Frame and Hip Escape
    
        *Opp. is sitting on top of one foot, low grip on gi pants, far arm under far leg. Everything begins with the lead shoulder. What keeps his shoulder in place is his head position.*
        
        1.  Post heel of near hand against opponent's shoulder.
        2.  Insert Cross Collar grip with far hand to block lead shoulder (hasn't solved far shoulder problem, opp. can shake his head left and right).
        3.  Hip out to the far side and bring knee as a wedge to his far shoulder. My knee and elbow connect.
        4.  As soon as I can, shift a little more out and bring my foot to his shoulder.
        5.  Pummel foot through, make space and free trapped leg.
        6.  Immediately go to Closed Guard.
    
    3.  Phase 2: [Opponent in Tripod] $\rightarrow$ Move Head
    
        *Too late to prevent lead shoulder position, he has connected his shoulder to my centerline and placed his head in position. I must try to prevent him from covering my knee. Before he covers my knee, I can attempt to move his head to the other side.*
        
        1.  Take my forearm and hold his head.
        2.  Push off my knee and straighten my body out. Moving my body around his head.
        3.  Take opposite elbow over his head and start to come up (using my leg like a pendulum), reaching to grab his belt and covering his head.
        4.  Grab his gi pants and bump him down to his shoulder.
            1.  If he brings his head back to the center, go to Triangle Lock / Closed Guard instead.
        5.  Place hand on the floor and come up.

2.  Seated Guard $\rightarrow$ Collar Sleeve

    *The game is about getting a single Straight Sleeve Grip. Everything comes from there.*
    
    1.  Establish Collar and Sleeve grips. (I can set this up with just the sleeve, by being aggressive with the Half Lasso.)
    2.  Fall back immediately. Right foot to bicep, left foot takes Half Lasso (in front of neck).
    3.  Goal is to get his gripped hand above my hips.
    4.  Now the left foot can safely unwind and go to the hip.
    5.  Left foot is responsible for the posture control.

3.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Triangle

    1.  First ensure his posture is properly broken.
    2.  Turn to my left hip (move my hips out a bit to my right), so that my left knee is inside his knee.
        -   This ensures that if he squats back, it doesn't save him from the Triangle.
    3.  Stomp down with both feet, pull him forward, and raise my hips into his armpit.
    4.  Right foot moves first, then left.

4.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep

    1.  Move foot from bicep to hip.
    2.  Push away with both feet while pulling my hips off the mat and underneath my opponent.
    3.  Pull my partner forward with my grips and tuck my knees to my chest.
    4.  Extend my legs and pull the collar over my head.
    5.  At the last moment, push the collar down towards my hips to flip my opponent overhead.
    6.  Back roll to mount.

5.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Grip Break] $\rightarrow$ Tripod Sweep

6.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Combat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep

    *Note that Combat Base requires that he has his knee inside my knee. If he doesn't $\rightarrow$ Triangle.*

7.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ [Clears the Foot] $\rightarrow$ Collar Sleeve De La Riva $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep

8.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Squat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep

    1.  Set up for Overhead Sweep as above, but partner bases back when I try to pull him forward (Step 3).
    2.  I use a pendulum motion to take the near side foot to Deep DLR Hook and I tuck his sleeve behind my calf. (I want my hips out to the side)
    3.  Push with my right foot and invert to left shoulder to finish (DLR Dump Sweep Position).
    4.  As he starts to fall, release the Sleeve Grip.

9.  Collar Sleeve $\rightarrow$ Overhead Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Squat Base] $\rightarrow$ DLR Dump Sweep $\rightarrow$ [Back Step Base] $\rightarrow$ Cross Sleeve DLR $\rightarrow$ Back Take

    *NOTE: This is experimental.*
    
    1.  I am attempting the Dump Sweep, but my opponent's base is too good OR he back steps his far leg.
    2.  Make sure my hips are out to the side (on top of his foot) and my hook is deep.
    3.  Release the Collar Grip and pass his sleeve from my left hand to my right hand.
    4.  Plant my right foot on the mat and try to kick him back with my Deep DLR hook.
    5.  Also use that base to hip escape towards his far leg so that I can grip his leg with my left hand.
    6.  Pummel my right foot inside and use it to square myself behind him. The pants and sleeve grip prevent motion to either side.
    7.  Once I'm square, reach my right hand up to his belt or pants.

10. DLR Dump Sweep $\rightarrow$ Basic Berimbolo

    1.  From DLR Dump Sweep: Left leg is Deep DLR Hook, right leg on top, right hand Armpit Collar Grip.
    2.  Use the Collar Grip and pull myself in to head butt my opponent's hip. As I raise my elbow, I invert, ducking my head under my arm $\rightarrow$ Berimbolo Position.
    3.  Hook both feet on the far side of my opponent (active toes / back heeling).
    4.  Reach my left hand for his far hip and grab the pants.
    5.  Roll over my right shoulder and kick my feet hard to the mat.
    6.  Pull right hand out and reach for the back of the collar.
    7.  Pull myself up until my head is above his head and then insert second hook (left leg). Push off the mat with my feet to help the climb.
