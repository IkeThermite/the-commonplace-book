# The Commonplace Book

My goal is to create a webpage to serve as a personal knowledge
management system (PKM) or [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). I'm inspired by the [Everything I
know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) PKM Gitbook by [Nikita
Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/) as well the [Building a Second
Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course by [Tiago
Forte](https://www.fortelabs.co/). I have provided my own take on his
system [here](#here).

Although I use [Evernote](#Evernote) for note management fairly
effectively, its formatting is not rich enough for what I want to
achieve. An option was [Notion](#Notion) but I am committed to storing
all my knowledge in plain text.

I previously considered two other options for this webpage, before settling on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/):

-   Pelican, which uses Python and can use either Markdown or
    reStructuredText (I've kept notes [here](https://www.ralphrudd.com/docs/3-areas/programming/working_with_pelican/) and [here](https://www.ralphrudd.com/docs/3-areas/programming/minimal_pelican_webpage/))
-   Jekyll, which uses Ruby and Markdown (I've used this before, but failed to keep good notes)


**Design Goals:**

I want my webpage to be *static*, *minimalist*, *energy efficient* and *fast*.
Furthermore, it must be *simple* enough that I can understand all parts of it.

**Content Goals:**

-   Technical tutorials to remind myself how to accomplish complex tasks
-   Easy to navigate Brazilian Jiu Jitsu knowledge database
