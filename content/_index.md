# The Commonplace Book

My goal is to create a webpage to serve as a personal knowledge
management system (PKM). I'm inspired by the [Everything I
know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) PKM Gitbook by [Nikita
Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/) as well the [Building a Second
Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course by [Tiago
Forte](https://www.fortelabs.co/). I have provided my own take on his
system [here](#here).

Although I use [Evernote](#Evernote) for note management fairly
effectively, its formatting is not rich enough for what I want to
achieve. An option was [Notion](#Notion) but I am committed to storing
all my knowledge in plain text.

What I want for my webpage:

-   Static
-   Minimalist
-   Energy efficient
-   Fast
-   Complete easy workflow from within Emacs
    -   Perhaps something like org-mode to md to html?
-   Something simple enough that I can understand it's inner workings

What I want my webpage to contain:

-   Technical tutorials to remind myself how to accomplish complex tasks
    -   Perhaps even checklists as motivated by [The Checklist
        Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)?
-   Easy to navigate Brazilian Jiu Jitsu knowledge database

Other options I considered for creating this webpage:

-   Pelican, which uses Python and can use either Markdown or
    reStructuredText
-   Jekyll, which uses Ruby and Markdown (and which I've used briefly
    before)
-   Gitbooks, based on Github and used by Nikita

Things I don't yet know how to do:

-   Continuous integration and deployment with Travis CI
